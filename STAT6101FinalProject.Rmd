# STAT6101 Final Project

## Uniform Case

```{r}

p_unif <- sort(runif(1000, min = 0, max = 1))

# budget is allowed budget, method is the type of shifting
# allowed method types: 
  # shifting as many people to 1 as much as the budget allows
  # shifting everyone an equal amount
  # shifting a section of people in the middle to a certain threshold...?
shift_probs <- function(probs, budget, method) {
  
  if (method == "max") {
    
    i = 1000;
    while (budget >= (1 - probs[i])^2) {
      budget = budget - (1 - probs[i])^2
      probs[i] = 1
      i = i -1
    }
    
  } else if (method == "uniform") {
    n <- length(probs)
    add_prob <- sqrt(budget / n)
    
    probs = pmin(probs + add_prob, 1)
  }
  
  return(probs)
}
